/**
 * <h1>Threading Questions in Job Interviews</h1>
 * <h2>Sourced from the Java&trade; Specialist's Newsletter</h2>
 * <h3>Issue 265</h3>
 * Abstract:
 * Asking detailed threading questions during an interview is like asking a
 * football player to prove that he can sing well. Not necessarily relevant to
 * their job description. And yet we see this commonly for Java jobs. In this
 * newsletter we consider more than a dozen real questions that technical
 * interviewers have asked.
