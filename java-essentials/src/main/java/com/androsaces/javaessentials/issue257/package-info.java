/**
 * <h1>CountDownLatch vs Phaser</h1>
 * <h2>Sourced from the Java&trade; Specialist's Newsletter</h2>
 * <h3>Issue 257</h3>
 * Abstract:
 * Java 7 gave us a brilliant new class called Phaser, which we can use to
 * coordinate actions between threads. It replaces both {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch}
 * and {@link java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier}, which are easier to
 * understand, but harder to use.
