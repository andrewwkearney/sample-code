 * <h1>HttpClient Executors</h1>
 * <h2>Sourced from the Java&trade; Specialist's Newsletter</h2>
 * <h3>Issue 270</h3>
 * Abstract:
 * Java 11 added the HttpClient to give us a better way to send HTTP requests.
 * It supports asynchronous and synchronous mode. HTTP2 comes out of the box.
 * The threading is a bit funky though and Professor Cay Horstmann explores how
 * things work underneath the covers.
 * </p>
 * See the email for more details about how to resolve the issue.
