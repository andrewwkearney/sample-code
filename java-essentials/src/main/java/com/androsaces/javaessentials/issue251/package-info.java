/**
 * <h1>Collections.checkedCollection()</h1>
 * <h2>Sourced from the Java&trade; Specialist's Newsletter</h2>
 * <h3>Issue 251</h3>
 * Abstract:
 * Since Java 5, we have been able to create collections that would check at
 * runtime that the objects added were of the correct type. But very few Java
 * programmers know about it. The benefit we get in debugging ease is huge, as
 * exceptions are thrown earlier.
