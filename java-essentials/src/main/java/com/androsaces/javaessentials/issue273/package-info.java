/**
 * <h1>Truly Public Methods</h1>
 * <h2>Sourced from the Java&trade; Specialist's Newsletter</h2>
 * <h3>Issue 273</h3>
 * Abstract:
 * Class.getMethods() returns all the public methods in this class and the
 * classes in its ancestry. However, we cannot necessarily call these methods,
 * for example if they are declared in a private inner class or a lambda. In
 * this newsletter we attempt to find all truly public methods.
