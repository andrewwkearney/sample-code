/**
 * <h1>Introduction</h1>
 * The following chapter introduces the {@link java.util.concurrent} package.
 * Within this package reside a bunch of interesting classes that provide
 * necessary and helpful functionality needed to implement multi-threaded
 * applications. After a discussion on how to use the Executor interface and its
 * implementation, the chapter covers atomic data types and concurrent data
 * structures. The final section throws light at the semaphores and count-down
 * latches.
