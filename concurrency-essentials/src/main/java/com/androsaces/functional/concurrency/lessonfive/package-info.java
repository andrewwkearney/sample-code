 * <h1>Fork/Join Framework</h1>
 * In this lesson, we discuss the Fork/Join Framework which is part of the JDK
 * since version 1.7. This framework provides a very handy set of classes that
 * can be used to write concurrent applications based on the relevant algorithm.
 * We will explore the main classes and provide examples on how to use them.
