/**
 * As we have seen in the last section we can let our thread sleep until it is
 * woken up by another thread. Another important feature of threads that you
 * will have to use from time to time is the ability of a thread to wait for
 * the termination of another thread.
 *
 * Letâ€™s assume you have to implement some kind of number crunching operation
 * that can be divided into several parallel running threads. The main thread
 * that starts the so called worker threads has to wait until all its child
 * threads have terminated.
