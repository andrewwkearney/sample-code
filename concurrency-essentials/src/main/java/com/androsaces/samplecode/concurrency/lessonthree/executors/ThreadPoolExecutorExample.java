/**
 * Under the hood the {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} maintains a pool of threads and
 * dispatches the instances of Runnable given the {@code execute()} method to
 * the pool. The arguments passed to the constructor control the behavior of the
 * thread pool. The constructor with the most arguments is the following one:
 *
 * {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#ThreadPoolExecutor(int, int, long, TimeUnit, BlockingQueue, ThreadFactory, RejectedExecutionHandler)}
 *
 * Letâ€™s go through the different arguments step by step:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>corePoolSize:</b> The {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} has an attribute
 *     {@code corePoolSize} that determines how many threads it will start until
 *     new threads are only started when the queue is full.</li>
 * <li><b>maximumPoolSize:</b> This attribute determines how many threads are
 *     started at the maximum. You can set this to {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} in
 *     order to have no upper boundary.</li>
 * <li><b>keepAliveTime:</b> When the {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} has created
 *     more than {@code corePoolSize} threads, a thread will be removed from the
 *     pool when it idles for the given amount of time.</li>
 * <li><b>unit:</b> This is just the {@code TimeUnit} for the keepAliveTime.</li>
 * <li><b>workQueue:</b> This queue holds the instances of Runnable given
 *     through the {@code execute()} method until they are actually started.</li>
 * <li><b>threadFactory:</b> An implementation of this interface gives you
 *     control over the creation of the threads used by the ThreadPoolExecutor.</li>
 * <li><b>handler:</b> When you specify a fixed size for the workQueue and
 *     provide a maximumPoolSize then it may happen, that the ThreadPoolExecutor
 *     is not able to execute your Runnable instance due to saturation. In this
 *     case the provided handler is called and gives you control over what
 *     should happen in this case.</li>
 * </ul>
